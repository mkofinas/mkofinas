### Hi there üëã

My name is Miltiadis (Miltos) Kofinas, and I am a PhD student in the [Video & Image Sense Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/) at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Efstratios Gavves](https://egavves.com/). My research focuses on future spatio-temporal forecasting, with applications on forecasting for autonomous vehicles. My research interests include graph neural networks, neural fields, and geometric deep learning.

Prior to my PhD, I received a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. For my Diploma thesis, I researched the topic of Scene Graph Generation using Graph Neural Networks, supervised by [Christos Diou](https://diou.github.io/) and [Anastasios Delopoulos](https://mug.ee.auth.gr/people/anastasios-delopoulos/). During my studies, I was a computer vision & machine learning engineer at [P.A.N.D.O.R.A. Robotics](https://pandora.ee.auth.gr/pandora-robotics/).

<!--
We propose roto-translated local coordinate frames for all nodes-objects in the geometric graphs of interacting dynamical systems.
Each local coordinate frame is centered at the target object and rotated to match its orientation.
Experiments on a number of 2D/3D settings, including pedestrians in traffic scenes and interacting charged particles, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
