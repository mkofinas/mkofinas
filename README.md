### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miltiadis (Miltos) Kofinas, and I am a PhD student in the Video & Image Sense Lab at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Efstratios Gavves](https://egavves.com/). My research focuses on future spatio-temporal forecasting, with applications on forecasting for autonomous vehicles. My research interests include graph neural networks, temporal dynamics, geometric deep learning and equivariant representations.

Prior to my PhD, I received a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. For my Diploma thesis, I researched the topic of Scene Graph Generation using Graph Neural Networks. During my studies, I was a computer vision & machine learning engineer at [P.A.N.D.O.R.A. Robotics](https://pandora.ee.auth.gr/pandora-robotics/).
